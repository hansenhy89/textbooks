                <div class="paragraph">I am an enthusiastic and dynamic language teacher who loves helping students explore a new part of themeselves and master a new skill. For the last 7 years I have taught English around the globe in 5 different countries (China, Taiwan, Spain, Peru, and France) and I am adept in working with students from different cultural backgrounds.
                I have a Bachelor's degree in International Studies from Brigham Young University Idaho and a Master's degree in Second Language Teaching from Utah State University. I consider myself a flexible, versatile, and positive individual and I love working with people. I really care about my students and want to give them the highest quality education.
